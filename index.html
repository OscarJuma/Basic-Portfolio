                I was first introduced to computers at the age of 20 and was amazed at what they could do back then. It has been a couple of decades and I finally decided to stop being scared of "breaking" the computer and venture under the skin. My goal for now is to be a full stack developer. <br>
                I'm currently a manufacturing shift coordinator with Texas Instruments. It is a position that I enjoy but feel that I can add much more as a full stack developer. In my world, I cringe at the word PMT (where page simple web pages solutions go to die).<br>
                I did not know I would enjoy being on a computer this much. Watching pages emerge and solve issues for customers is deeply gratifying. Here I am... drinking water from a firehose and not drowned yet.</p>
